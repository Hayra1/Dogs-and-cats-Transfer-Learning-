# Transfer Learning with PyTorch

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates **Transfer Learning** using **PyTorch**. Transfer learning allows you to leverage pre-trained models to solve new tasks with less data and training time, making it especially useful for deep learning applications.

## Overview

In this notebook, we perform transfer learning on a given dataset by fine-tuning a pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet, VGG) from the PyTorch model library. The primary objective is to showcase how to adapt a model trained on a large dataset (like ImageNet) to a specific task with fewer data.

### Key Features:
- **Pre-trained Model Loading**: Use models like ResNet, VGG, etc.
- **Fine-tuning**: Modify the model's last few layers to adapt it to a custom dataset.
- **Training**: Train the fine-tuned model on the target dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on unseen test data.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Other dependencies like `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.

You can install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook transferlearning.ipynb
   ```

5. Run the notebook cells step by step to understand and execute transfer learning.

## Results

The notebook will display training progress, loss, accuracy, and test results, showcasing how transfer learning improves the modelâ€™s performance.

## Customization

You can modify the following:
- Change the pre-trained model architecture (ResNet, VGG, etc.).
- Adjust learning rates, optimizers, and other hyperparameters.
- Fine-tune additional layers or freeze specific layers.
